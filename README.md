# blackjack-strats
Scala project attempting various blackjack strategies vs The House

I wrote this many years ago as a way of checking various strategies against a robotic dealer player. I only wrote two strategies - never bust (don't hit if hand is above 11), or dealer strategy (stand on 17).  You can specify how many decks are in the shoe and how many games to run through. At the end, your win/loss ratio is shown.

I did not write this in the most "functional" scala way, so forgive me.
